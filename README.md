# Kotlin Prime and Even Numbers

A simple Kotlin console application that demonstrates list manipulation.

## Description

This program performs two main tasks:

1. It calculates the **first 50 prime numbers** (starting from 2) and stores them in a list.  
2. It then prints this list.  
3. Next, it generates a list of the **first 50 even numbers** (2, 4, 6, ..., 100).  
4. It adds this list of even numbers to the end of the original prime number list.  
5. Finally, it prints the combined list.

## How to Run

You can run this code directly in the [Kotlin Playground](https://play.kotlinlang.org/) or compile and run it from the command line:

```bash
# Compile the code
kotlinc Main.kt -include-runtime -d Main.jar

# Run the compiled JAR
java -jar Main.jar

This is the exact text that the program will print to the console.
